# Tempus
Productivity app

The idea behind this project is to develop an Android application which would help people to assess themselves, their work efficiency and their effective time utilisation. The user has to enter ze’s schedule in the app and then the app tracks the user’s progress and completion of tasks, as mentioned by the user, in the stipulated time, which also is allotted by the user, while updating the user's plan for the following day. The app gives an alarm to start the day by waking up the user at the scheduled time. The user ticks the tasks after their completion. This way the app tracks the progress of the user, by checking whether the tasks scheduled for the day are complete and if there are any remaining tasks left to be completed on that day. 

                          
This application also provides a feature where various users can form groups, add team members and assign tasks to them. Once a team member completes a task, everyone knows that the task is finished.
